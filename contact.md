I’m an avid reader with years of experience in copyediting and writing. If you have a story you want to publish, I’m here to make it happen! I can offer edits and suggestions that can improve the story line, identify plot holes holding the work back, review for grammatical mistakes, or write an honest book review after reading. I enjoy literary fiction, sci-fi/fantasy, young adult/new adult fiction, humor/satire, romance, and horror.  My website is called BookEnJenn because I never stopped reading when I first found out that there are virtual libraries. What started as a form of escapism turned into a hobby where I encourage readers to read from new authors, whether their debut, self-published, or translated from another languages. I want to help authors find their audience before their book is published.
