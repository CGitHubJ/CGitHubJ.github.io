Evelyn has never reached her 18th birthday; for thousands of years, she's doomed to kill or be killed by Arden, her soulmate. This time, Evelyn needs to live long enough to undergo surgery to save her sister, but as her birthday approaches, so does the curse that binds her and Arden together. As the duo grows closer again, Evelyn asks herself what she would do for love.

Our Infinite Fates has monumental flashbacks that slowly reveal Evelyn and Arden's conflict and love for each other, and they were my favorite parts of the book. As interesting as the flashbacks throughout history were, I saw the curse more than I saw the romance between Evelyn and Arden, and I wish we had moments that weren't before their deaths that we see them more casual or intimate with each other. The pacing between Arden and Evelyn in the major plot line doesn't compare between the flashbacks because of the reveal.

Arden spent the entire book before the reveal saying he would never say why the curse was the way it was, only for Evelyn to find a way to break the curse. While I never would have guessed the reveal, I think it would have been better if it had happened before the surgery; that way, Evelyn would have had more time to think of a way to break the curse.

This book is a four-star read due to the beautiful writing; adding poetry between chapters was a nice touch. I haven't read anything from the author, but I plan to do so this year and the next ðŸ˜‰

Thank you, Netgalley, Laura Steven, and Wednesday Books for this phenomenal book!
